This project involves creating a positive test case using JMeter. The test scenario includes administrative tasks such as agent and customer creation, 
financial transactions, and balance verification. The steps include depositing funds from the system account to the agent, transferring funds from the 
agent to the customer, checking the customer's balance, withdrawing funds from the customer's account, making a payment to a merchant account, and asserting
the expected customer balance. The goal is to validate the system's functionality and ensure successful execution of these operations.
